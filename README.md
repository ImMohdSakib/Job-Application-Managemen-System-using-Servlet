# Job Application Management System

## Overview

Job Application Management System is a web-based application that helps manage the user registration (signup), login, and job application processes. This system provides a way for candidates to apply for jobs, and it also handles user authentication and tracks their job applications. The project uses Java Servlets to handle HTTP requests and MySQL for database operations.

## Features

- **User Registration**: New users can sign up with their name, email, and password.
- **User Login**: Existing users can log in to their dashboard.
- **Job Application**: Users can fill out job applications with their personal, educational, and job preference details.
- **Database Integration**: MySQL is used for storing user and job application data.

## Technologies Used

- **Java Servlets**: For handling HTTP requests and business logic.
- **MySQL**: For storing user and job application data.
- **JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)**: To connect Java code with the MySQL database.
- **HTML/CSS**: For building the frontend (forms for login, signup, and job application).
